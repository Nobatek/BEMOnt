<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This semantic model is focused on describing the sensor representation inside a building. This model  represents the building electrical elements as either a system, a device, or a sensor. In detail, systems can be composed of systems, devices (or multiple devices could take part of the same system), or sensors, which can also take part of devices (or multiple sensors could take part of the same device).  To do so, we align SSN and IFC, with HIT2GAP ontology.</span>
