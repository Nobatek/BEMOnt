## Driver Specification

Drivers represent the stimulating factors that provoke energy occupant behavior. Hence, the drivers corresponds with the measurements of building systems that interacts with the different occupants. Therefore, bem:Drivers are the glue between actions and an occupant needs.

The corresponding class in the data model is a member of observation (ssn:Observation), as it is made of each of the observations required for simulating a user behaviour. Four different kind of drivers are considered:


* _Behaviour Model_: As variables that serve to measure the habits and activities inside the building. It is defined to register and contextualise the occupant events (building interactions with the different systems).
* _Activity Model_: As a class for registering the the occupants activities (relate to occupancy) inside the building.
* _Event Model_: Defined to register the events that can be detected from the sensor readings.
* _Equipement Model_: As a class for measuring the building features and the environmental factors including indoor and outdoor parameters.
