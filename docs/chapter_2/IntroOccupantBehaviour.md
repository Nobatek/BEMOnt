# Occupant Behaviour Modelling

## Introduction and Overall Overview of the Occupant Behaviour Ontology

This chapter is aimed at describing the general model referring the occupant behaviour. In that sense and according with [(Hong et al.,2015)][@Honng2015], the occupant behaviour is composed by the following main aspects:

- **Drivers**: Represent discrete-event simulation models for modeling occupant behavior, activities, events, and equipments, considering the factors that stimulate occupants in accomplishing some actions to reach their needs.
- **Needs**: Model the requirements that the different occupants shall meet to ensure their satisfaction in their environments.
- **Actions**: Model the occupants interactions with the building to achieve the required comfort.

Considering these three main aspects, the constructed [semantic model](https://cdn.rawgit.com/HIT2GAP-EU-PROJECT/BEMOnt/gh-pages/owlSpecificationDoc/index-en.html) relies on the combination of the Drivers, Needs, and Actions with the representation of the building infrastructure (i.e., aligning the model with the IFC) and the different observations that could occur in the building (SSN ontology).
