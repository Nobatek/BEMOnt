A semantic model to represent building infrastructure and occupants interactions\nIntroduction\nHit2Gap Ontology is focused on establishing a common data model and semantic knowledge management for buildings and their sensor networks, including their interaction with the occupants. With this aim, the proposed ontology will take into consideration the following aspects:\n\nBuilding infrastructure data models and semantic representation (Building Infrastructure Ontology & Building Appliance Ontology): as mechanims to represent the different systems and infrastructure involved in Building Information Modelling (BIM) and required for the performance of the project tools (building simulation tools, building monitoring tools, visualization tools, etc.).\n\nSensor data and sensor network infrastructure models and semantic representation (Sensor Representation Ontology & Property Ontology): as a mechanism to represent sensor data and sensor network infrastructures that are supported in the BIM.\n\nUser Behaviour data models and semantic representation (User Behaviour Ontology): this part of the ontology is aimed at representing building occupants DNA (Drivers, Needs, and Actions). This type of modelling will serve to represent the user-building interaction not only in form of activities but also considering comfort parameters and other aspects that motivate users to perform building actions.\n\nBuilding Grid Representation (OntoMG Ontology):this specific part of the ontology is focused on describing energetic contextualization of a building within a micro grid.\n\n\nTherefore and since semantic representation, HIT2GAP project will harmonise all inforamtion related to buildings monitoring and control activities (management activities), considering the user as an important aspect to adjust energy according to their preferences.\nHit2Gap Ontology is based on various ontologies that can be considered as standard in the domain:\n\nIndustry Foundation Classes OWL (IfcOWL)(Pauwels,2017): This semantic model is used as a reference for modelling the building information and lifecycle. As a reference building for construction, this semantic model is one of the core ontologies to be linked with SSN and extended in HIT2GAP by several concepts (orientation, capacity, etc.) and user behaviour aspects to cope with the project requirements.\nSemantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN)(Compton et al.,2012): This semantic model represents sensor information and data in form of observation. Hence, this ontology permits to contextualise sensor information being also compatible with the current standards in information exchange as SensorML.\nQuantities, Units, Dimensions and Time (QUDT)(Hodgson et al.,2014): This semantic model is aimed at representing units and unit conversion for the time series and sensor outputs represented through the SSN ontology.\nW3C Time Ontology (TIME)(Cox and Little,2012): Time ontology allows to contextualise the time measurements and time instants. This aspect will serve as a complementary semantic model for the QUDT ontology regarding time measurements.\nW3C Geospatial Ontology (W3CGeo)(Lieberman et al.,2007): This semantic model will serve to represent geospatial capabilities;\n\n"},"chapter_1/Basics.html":{"url":"chapter_1/Basics.html","title":"Basics","keywords":"","body":"Basics\nContribution Basics\nFor those contributors in the documentation, it cloud be done:\n\nDirectly from Github and making commits. Then, automatically the repository is linked with a continous integration tool (CircleCI) that automatically update the gh-pages branch and the visualization\n\nMaking a clone of the repository (using for example Github Desktop tool) an then, make your changes in a different branch that lately has to be merged with the master branch. Once in the master branch is detected a change, \"gh-pages\" is directly updated.\n\n\nGitbooks Basics\nGitbooks uses markdown as an style to writing the document:\n\nGitbook Documentation\n\nMarkdown Cheatsheet\n\n\nTo edit markdown files locally, you can use Atom with the Markdown viewer plugin. Moreover, you can also use IntelliJ with the corresponding Markdown viewer or other text editor you like.\nGraphs Basics\nFor easy integration and modification of the class diagrams, it is used PlantUML and PlantUML Server.\nFor example, given the following diagram code in plantuml:\n@startuml\nBob -> Alice : hello\n@enduml\n\nEvery contributor can load the respective generated image from plantuml server:\n![Label](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/png/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000)\n\nGiven as a result:\n\n"},"chapter_2/IntroOccupantBehaviour.html":{"url":"chapter_2/IntroOccupantBehaviour.html","title":"Occupant Behaviour","keywords":"","body":"Occupant Behaviour Modelling\nIntroduction and Overall Overview of the Occupant Behaviour Ontology\nThis chapter is aimed at describing the general model referring the occupant behaviour. In that sense and according with (Hong et al.,2015), the occupant behaviour is composed by the following main aspects:\n\nDrivers: Represent discrete-event simulation models for modeling occupant behavior, activities, events, and equipments, considering the factors that stimulate occupants in accomplishing some actions to reach their needs.\nNeeds: Model the requirements that the different occupants shall meet to ensure their satisfaction in their environments.\nActions: Model the occupants interactions with the building to achieve the required comfort.\n\nConsidering these three main aspects, the constructed semantic model relies on the combination of the Drivers, Needs, and Actions with the representation of the building infrastructure (i.e., aligning the model with the IFC) and the different observations that could occur in the building (SSN ontology).\n"},"chapter_2/OccupantSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/OccupantSpecification.html","title":"Ocupant Specification","keywords":"","body":"Occupant/User Specification\nBuilding Actors (ifc:Actors) in the building make reference to each people that take part in the building, interacting with it through configuring the devices (managers) or event to determine the occupancy of different zones (occupants). \nBased on this, the class Actors is represented as an entity that could interact with building devices (ssn:Device) for sensing building infrastructure or even interact with the different elements of the building to satisfy their defined needs (through ifc:Actuator). All of the actors interaction will depend on their role (bem:Role) that may vary from building manager, building owner or building technician to simple occupant.\nWe distinguish a specific actor as a building user (under the class bem:User) that refers to the people who use the HIT2GAP application. Such users are able to receive notifications for building infrastructure (e.g., recommendations and alerts) and to gather building status feedback. Moreover, building users also have some preferences in the representation of the different HIT2GAP notifications that could be performed in form of SMS, Email, or Phone.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding users can be refined; in particular occupants need to be distinguished for the User Behavior Modeling tool (under the class: Ifc:Occupant). Within the H2GOnto, an occupant is a building user who is moving around the building and is able to act over specific building devices in case the building policies permit the interaction. Within the semantic model, building occupants are characterized by:\n\nA specific attitude (bem:Attitude) inside the building corresponding with the energy awareness (e.g., Energy Frugal, Energy Profligate, Energy Indifferent).\n\nDepending on the interactions and the building type, the occupants interact with the building according to a role (bem:Role) inside a company that allows them to do some action.\n\nHabits and a behaviour inside the building (time to start working or end working, etc.) under the class bem:OccupantCharacteristics.\n\n\nEach of the occupants has several comfort needs based on, for example, the temperature, humidity, or luminosity for specific zones of the building. The needs, as explained later in the document, will serve to associate occupant preference with the real status of the building to derive discomfort states. The interaction of occupants with the system is represented through their actions.\n\n    \n\n"},"chapter_2/NeedsSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/NeedsSpecification.html","title":"Needs Definition","keywords":"","body":"Needs Specification\nNeeds represent the requirements that has to be satisfied to ensure the occupants comfort in the building.\nWithin the elaborated semantic model, needs are related with the different occupant preferences considering, for each preference, maximum and minimum values. The occupant preferences refer to the level of luminosity, noise, and temperature with the possibility to expand it in case of necessity. Moreover, the class bem:Needs is also aligned to the level of privacy of the information and opinion of the occupants.\n\n\n\n\nAs an specification of the needs entity, different models and comforts perspectives will serve to model and measure the occupant satisfaction with the building conditions. In that sense, the following models are considered:\n\nThermal Comfort Model: To measure thermal occupants needs and analyse if they are in the correspoding suitable values. For measuring thermal comfort, there will be considered the (i) ISO Adaptive Comfort; (ii) ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort(Brager et al.,2001); and (iii) ASHRAE Adaptive Envelope(Hoovestol and Mikuls,2011). Posibility to link other kind of models is open in the semantic modelling.\nVisual Comfort: Aligned with measures and models referent to visual and luminosity aspects.\nAcoustic Comfort: Referring the optimal noise levels in the different building zones.\nIndoor Air Quality (IAQ): As a model to analyse and evaluate the indoor air quality.\n\n"},"chapter_2/DriverSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/DriverSpecification.html","title":"Drivers Definition","keywords":"","body":"Driver Specification\nDrivers represent the stimulating factors that provoke energy occupant behavior.

Four different kind of drivers are considered:\n\nBehaviour Model: As variables that serve to measure the habits and activities inside the building. It is defined to register and contextualise the occupant events (building interactions with the different systems).\nActivity Model: As a class for registering the the occupants activities (relate to occupancy) inside the building.\nEvent Model: Defined to register the events that can be detected from the sensor readings.\nEquipement Model: As a class for measuring the building features and the environmental factors including indoor and outdoor parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"chapter_2/ActionSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/ActionSpecification.html","title":"Actions and Building State Definition","keywords":"","body":"Action and Building State Specification\nActions are interactions performed by a building occupant in the building itself. They can be caused by an initial discomfort or occupant event. Nevertheless, actions are connected with drivers at time as a change of parameter is observed in the building facilities. Moreover, actions have also some influence on the needs as they are usually performed to satisfy user comfort requirements.\nIn modelling terms, actions are strongly connected with the building state that is introduced to contextualize and determine the building facilities status. The building state can be divided in two categories:\n\nSimple building states correspond to the states of specific facilities or systems (cooler on/off, open/closed door, etc.). These aspects are derived in the ontology based on the analogue or continuous signal of the sensors.\n\nComplex building states refer to the states that require for the combination of different facilities to determine an overall state. For example, one complex state is the determination of the energy state of the building that can be energy efficient state or energy inefficient state considering anomalous energy consumption (e.g., thermostat on at the same time as some windows are open). Similarly, comfort state determination corresponds to building complex state. In that sense, occupant discomfort will occur when the building does not satisfy user\nrequirements (comparison between needs and drivers).\n\n\nTherefore, the building and the systems are linked with the bem:BuildingState class to identify and categorize the current building situation. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an alert or discomfort occurs, an action is triggered, which can either be an occupant event, a system action, an inaction, or a feedback. Usually, an action is intended to solve or even to modify a building state.

The first one is covered through the use of the SSN ontology; the second one is covered by integrating IFC concepts. Some researches intend to elaborate a version of the IFC compatible with standard formats of the web semantic (ifcOwl), to adapt SSN to building domain or as latest trend to extend the SAREF ontology (Daniela et al.,2015) from smart homes to building management.\nThe semantic representation of the building infrastructure is not a new research topic (Anzaldi et al.,2014) (Mcglinn et al.,2015). Usually, semantic approaches are focused on describing the building elements (infrastructure, zones, electrical, and mechanical aspects of the building). While various standard formats for describing the building elements exist, IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is of particular interest as it is an open project for the standardization of the BIM (Building Information Modelling); moreover, a semantic ontology has been developed for it, under the name ifcOwl. This semantic model permits to link the OntoH2G with the BIM notation (Volk et al.,2014). Despite the advantages brought by the IFC, its use is not straightforward due to the amount of information it contains, most of it not being relevant for specific uses. Moreover, considering building information as a whole may cause unreadability in querying the building information and the derivation of its status (Anzaldi et al.,2014).\nNevertheless, IFC proposes different categories (called domains) that group elements according to some interest. In the HIT2GAP project, we selected:\n\nthe IfcProductExtension which contains physical objects that are relevant in describing the building/site. In particular, we are interested in the spatial structure of a building site through the IfcSpatialStructureElements, and IfcZones classes.\nthe IfcBuildingControlsDomain which includes monitoring and control elements such as sensors, actuators, alarms..., which are instances of the IfcDistributionControlElement class.\n\nthe IfcHvacDomain (for elements that are used to describe heat, ventilation and air- conditioning systems), IfcElectricalDomain (for elements related with electricity production/consumption/storage). All the elements of interest are accessible under the IfcFlowStorageDevice, IfcFlowMovingDevice, IfcFlowController, IfcFlowTerminal,\nIfcFlowTreatmentDevice and IfcEnergyConversionDevice classes.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Haystack(Haystack,2017) data model has been identified as a high-potential model to develop a common vocabulary for the monitoring of buildings. While this model is not presented as a web semantic ontology, it has been integrated as a complement of the ifcOwl model.\nThe original ifcOwl has also been enhanced with additional information:\n\nEach building pertains to a specific type (through the \"hasType\" semantic relation) \nEach zone in a building can be characterized as a room, floor, desk, etc... \n\nMoreover, different views of a building can be used: infrastructure to represent the floors, rooms...; but also an electric view (to represent the electric appliances inside the building), fluid view (to represent the possible flow of water/gas inside the building), etc.\nThe features of interest representation of the building are performed using standard building modelling (IFC and BIM). Moreover, the proposed ontology ensures the information compatibility and sharing with these models. Finally, the building infrastructure and their corresponding zones and devices are modelled and linked with their corresponding information, aspect that facilitates data querying based on the corresponding feature of interests.\n\n    \n\n\n\n"},"chapter_3/Observation_Measurement.html":{"url":"chapter_3/Observation_Measurement.html","title":"Building Sensor Representation","keywords":"","body":"Building Sensors Representation\nBuilding sensors are represented using the generic “Semantic Sensor Network” (SSN) ontology (Compton et.al,2012). This model (see Figure bellow), represents a building monitoring equipment as a system, a device, or a sensor. In detail, systems can be composed of systems, devices (or multiple devices could take part of the same system) and/or sensors, which can also be part of devices (or multiple sensors could take part of the same device).\nSensor measurements (or ssn:Observation in the SSN ontology and in the data model), refer to measurements generated either by building devices or by people interacting with the building (e.g., changes in temperature set-points). The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) (Botts,2013) defines the ‘Observation and Measurement’ standard model to represent sensor information. An Observation is characterized by:\n\nthe sensor performing the measure under the concept ssn:Sensor;\nthe object/property measured: ssn:Property; this typically referes to the physical value\ncaptured by the sensor (for instance, temperature, CO2 rate, etc.);\nthe context of the object being monitored or observed: ssn:FeatureOfInterest; this can, for\ninstance, refer to a specific zone in the building; and\nthe specific measurement as a result of the observation (ssn:Result).\n\nMoreover, because the data storage solution deployed in the HIT2GAP solution is dual, with the use of a system dedicated to the storage of time series data, an observation must be associated with an external ID, which refers to the time series data stored in Mondas, in the current development.\nThis model allows contextualizing all related sensor information, the type of information that is being observed as well as information regarding the sensor/device/system installed (thanks to the inheritance between elements, in particular ifc:Building, bem:BuildingAppliance, ifc:SpatialElement, ontomg:MicroGrid, ifc:BuildingElement, and ssn:FeatureOfInterest. As we will see in the following sections, the ssn:FeatureOfInterest is fundamental for aligning the different ontologies, as it is used to characterize the object that are in close relation with the property measured by a sensor.\nThe succession of observations can be analysed; it forms a time series that can be represented using a combination between the classes offered by the SSN ontology and the Quantity, Units, Dimensions, and Time (QUDT) ontology(Hodgson et.al,2014); SSN ontology provides the mechanisms to specify the values of the time series; the QUDT ontology provides mechanisms for representing specific measures and data conversions.\nTime intervals and temporal parameters of the observations and time series have been represented using W3C-Time ontology (Hobbs & Pan,2004). This semantic model facilitates the representation, abstraction, and conversion of temporal measurements. In detail, the time:Instant and time:DateTimeInterval were used to enable an observation to represent single value at a certain time or to represent multiple values (i.e. time series) during certain period of time.\nThis way to represent semantically the sensor information facilitates data integration over different building data sources, merge the information according to their measurements for instance, and enable data provenance of the information based on describing sensor information (type of sensor, measurements, throughput, etc.).\n\n    \n\n\nConsidering this core-semantic and standard modelling of sensors based on the SSN ontology, the proposed HIT2GAP semantic model extends these classes by adapting it to the building domain. In detail, the main work performed focused on defining the different ssn:FeaturesOfInterest related to buildings (to represent zones, building layers, etc.) and energy management.\n"},"chapter_3/geo.html":{"url":"chapter_3/geo.html","title":"Geo-spatial Building Representation","keywords":"","body":"Geo-Spatial Representation of the Building Elements\nThe representation of geo-spatial information in the presented ontology is incorporated through the W3C Geo ontology (Hobbs & Pan,2006)]@Hobbs2006.
